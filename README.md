SL2P_python is a python implementation of the Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) in Weiss and Baret, 2016 (https://step.esa.int/docs/extra/ATBD_S2ToolBox_L2B_V1.1.pdf 34). SL2P is designed to estimate vegetation biophysical variables from Sentinel-2 (S2) MSI L2A multi-spectral images: leaf area index (LAI), fraction canopy cover (FCOVER), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and canopy water content (CWC), in addition to the Albedo and the directional area scattering factor (DASF) not considered in the original SL2P version. 

The user must specify:
-	the location of S2 to be used (locally saved).
-	the spatial resolution of used data: S2_SR (20-m) or S2_SR_10m (10-m}.
-	the needed vegetation variable: LAI, fAPAR, fCOVER, CCC, CWC, Albedo, or DASF,

The provided solution read the S2 image (SAFE format), prepare the SL2P input data (including data re-sampling, data scaling â€¦) run SL2P, and export products in GeoTIFF product.
The outputted product contains: 
-	Estimates of the selected vegetation variable, 
-	the uncertainty of estimates,  
-	SL2P inputs flag map,    
-	SL2P outputs flag map.  

A test dataset (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11BGcS0OA4EjGYb9XGfBtNPFpdgw10uWI?usp=drive_link) is provided for a quick test of SL2P_python as well as for comparison of outputs to the corresponding product obtained using the original SL2P version implemented on the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).
