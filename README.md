## Welcome to SL2P_PYTHON


SL2P_PYTHON is a python implementation of the Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) in [Weiss and Baret (2016)](https://step.esa.int/docs/extra/ATBD_S2ToolBox_L2B_V1.1.pdf) This implementation corresponds to the algorithm implemented in the [LEAf-Toolbox](https://github.com/rfernand387/LEAF-Toolbox) that corrects for bugs in the implemention of SL2P within the European Space Agency Sentinel 2 Toolbox as documented in [Fernandes et al. 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425723001517?via%3Dihub).


SL2P-PYTHON is designed to estimate vegetation biophysical variables [leaf area index (LAI), fraction canopy cover (FCOVER), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) and canopy water content (CWC), and albedo}  from Sentinel-2 MSI L2A images. 

The user must specify:
-	The location of S2 to be used (locally saved).
-	The spatial resolution of used data: S2_SR (20-m) or S2_SR_10m (10-m).
-	The needed vegetation variable: LAI, fAPAR, fCOVER, CCC, CWC or Albedo

SL2P-PYTHON read the S2 image (SAFE format), prepare the SL2P input data (including data re-sampling, data scaling â€¦), run SL2P, and export products in GeoTIFF.
The outputted product contains: 

-	Estimates of the selected vegetation variable,
-	Uncertainty of vegetation variable estimates,
-	SL2P inputs flag map where a value of 0 indicates valid inputs,
-	SL2P outputs flag map where a value of 0 indicates valid outputs.
  
A [test dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11BGcS0OA4EjGYb9XGfBtNPFpdgw10uWI?usp=drive_link) is provided for a quick test of SL2P_python as well as for comparison of outputs to the corresponding product obtained using the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) implementation of SL2P.
